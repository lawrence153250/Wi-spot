In order for everything to work, 
Open the api_keys.js then change the api key for the deepseek. 
Next step is to open the api_keys.php then change all the api keys for deepseek, xendit, and googlemaps.

Note: No need to change the deepseek api key yet, as it is still has remaining balance for request. Only change the api key if the chatbot ai no longer works. It means the request balance has been depleted.
